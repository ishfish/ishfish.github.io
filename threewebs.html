    <h1><bold>Three Websites ranked!</bold></h1>

    <div id="wrap">

        <h2>1.<a href= "https://www.apple.com/" target= _blank>Apple</a></h2>
        <p>I believe that a Billion dollar company needs to have modern technology and upon further inspection the website uses some great html elements on their front page. They use the code to direct us to links and even the huge displays are buttons. We all know how apple is very modern and sleek, the website flows in a very very smooth way it's almost like opening a new iphone of theirs. Even the drop down menus on the very top of the page are very nice to hover over. The hover color is also a bit transparent, if that makes sense, and everything in the website seems to flow really well together. Obviously the main page is going to have the most links and gateways to other sections, but this website has LOADS of portals seems like a pool of it. After seeing the work that goes into making a website it truly makes me really appreciate the beauty of a professionally designed website. When you scroll down to the bottom of the screen we can see the different lists and they fit seemlessly with the rest of the website, hovering over them there really is not much effect going on but the fact that they are all there and easy to access, wows me. They dont even stand out or anything crazy its something suttle that has intrigued me. When going to Mobile mode, most of the Menu's disappear and it becomes a lot more visually simple. Obviously the menu's are still there but stashed away so that the mobile version of the website isn't cluttered for the majority of the website viewers. The menu's below the website have now been replaced with drop down menu's, where we have to tap on the boxes to reveal more of that category. I feel like since they do make smartphones, the mobile site was most likely worked on the same if not more than the website for the desktop version. Something that I had also noticed which is a very cool minor detail, but clever, is that the iphone 15 advertised on the website is actually oriented horizontally on the desktop versions, but verticle for the handheld version.</p>

        <h2>2. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" target=_blank>Microsoft</a></h2>
        <p>Microsoft is one of the biggest company's in the world and the reason behind it is simple. Humans use technology everyday, and Microsoft specializes in Technology. The Website though, very, very nice, there would have to be something wrong with Microsoft's card if the website was not up to standards. The first thing that comes to mind while viewing this website is the very clear similarity to the Apple Website, but in a color scheme to that of Bing. It was very subtle to me but still evident. The top menus have an underline effect when hovered over and it is really themey. The whole website feels like it's designed with a theme. Where as in the Apple one it felt like it was just designed to be easy and satisfying to operate. Microsoft's website is very nice to look at though, with rotating images of a surface laptop and some AI generated art, makes the page seem like it has a personality and makes me want to scroll and explore more on the page. There is some inline boxes on the website and it feels as if they were purposely placed there to get the user to have to explore more of the website without making it too obvious. Lots of the buttons though have a cool effect of dettaching itself from  the button but then coming back, while you hover over the option of selecting it. There is also a floating button that only appears when you get to the latter part of the website and it says,"Back to top" and it seems very cool, it is a bit transparent so its not like it sticks out by any means, but I like the addition of it since it feels like this website was definitely designed for scrolling and advertising itself more, which no problem, since they do sell, A LOT of products and services. There is also a question that it asks you on the top about converting to bing, and once I clicked no, it had a nice fading effect. The entire top menu in the mobile version goes into a drop down menu and the icon turns in to a down an 'x' to close the menu once you opened it. There is also a pause button conveniently placed on the sliding images, and I guess the average person could use that to keep from so much movement to the eye. </p>

        <h2>3.<a href= "https://berkshirehathaway.com/" target="_blank">Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</a>(should be like WAY lower on the list)</h2>
        <p>Usually I would say last but not least, but in this case I cannot say the same. This website is very very plane, it feels like the css was hardly used, maybe a little on the title and color of links. The Entire layout of the website is very monochromatic. The websites colors dont even compliment eachother so it is very hard to enjoy the websites color scheme. It is a very recently updated website as well, but I guess their agency or something does not see the eyesore of a website. There are no buttons, no drop down menus, no hidden menus, no bachground, no life in this website. The Hover effects on the website are non-existent, and then even opening the links to reveal what those say, there is no courtesy to open it in a new tab so that I can just go right back to where I was. There is a change of color when I open a link though and revisit it, at least they have that going for them. The bullet points are hideous but better than a numbered list. On some of the links, there is a brief explanation of the links, for some. The layout is plain and even on mobile, nothing changes, it remains the same except for the fact that it does smoosh the links in a closer more personal way to one another. They do have a copyright symbol as well, and they have added the 'GEICO' logo in there which makes the website just that much easier to look at. </p>
