            <p>Summer is scorching hot, assocated with lots of sun and little dark time. When it is the prime time in the sun, people will have the best time with limitless lists of all the possibilities. Summer is a powerhouse. People like to wear shorts and go out in the water sources, hiking in the sun, and doing everything they possibly can in the time windows they have. </p>
