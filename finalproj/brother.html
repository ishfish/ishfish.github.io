            <p>Ricardo is my one and only brother and we bond over the fact that boys are minimal in our extended family. He is a really decent soccer player he actually trained with our team here in Carroll. He is currently a sophomore in highschool and I have passed him the torch and now he is a captain on the soccer team, a key player, and my old number. He is playing at a higher level than I was club wise and he is fighting for both club and school and he has the passion of a warrior. Check out his Clips!</p>
